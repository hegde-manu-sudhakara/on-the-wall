# On the wall
*January 20th, 2020*

## Introduction
A rendering of a contemporary kitchen implementing the illusion of depth via Material Design. The kitchen has a table (partially visible) with some freshly prepared food on it, a light, which is lit when it gets too dark. On the wall, we have a clock, tirelessly bringing presents from the future.
